## Battery Life Estimate

To estimate battery life:

 - Battery Life = Battery Capacity / Average Current Draw
 - Battery Life = 1800mAh / 281mA ‚âà 6.41 hours

 ### Important Notes:
This estimate assumes continuous operation with Wi-Fi enabled, periodic display refreshes, and sensor readings. In practical use, battery life can be significantly extended through:

- Low-power sleep modes on the ESP32  
- Reducing display update frequency  
- Disabling unused modules or interfaces 

# ESP32-C6 Pin Usage Breakdown

This section outlines the pin configuration used in the current hardware design based on the ESP32-C6 microcontroller.

## Power Connections
- **3V3 (Pin 2 & top-right corner)** ‚Äì Supplies 3.3V to the microcontroller and all connected peripherals.
- **GND (bottom-right corner)** ‚Äì Ground reference for the entire system.

## Boot and Reset
- **GPIO8 (Pin 15, IO/BOOT)** ‚Äì Used to enter bootloader mode; pulled low through a 10kŒ© resistor.

### Pin Mapping Considerations

This pin configuration is chosen to balance performance and modularity:
- The SPI bus supports high-speed data exchange with both the E-Paper Display and external flash memory.
- The I2C bus is reserved for lower-speed peripherals, such as the RTC and environmental sensors.
- Dedicated control signals for the display enable precise handling of rendering operations.
- UART is available for serial debugging or external communication.
- Power, reset, and enable signals are placed for ease of access and stability in the overall system layout.



## Design Constraints
- **PCB Dimensions**: Must fit within the predefined casing
- **Power Traces**: Width = 0.3mm, Data traces = 0.15mm minimum
- **No Right-Angle Traces**: Ensure smooth signal flow
- **Decoupling Capacitors**: 100nF placed near power pins
- **ESP32 Antenna Placement**: Must be at the PCB edge, with no ground plane underneath
